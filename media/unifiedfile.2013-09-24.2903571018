<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 18pt; text-decoration: underline;">Where Energy is Found &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Energy is all around us, and a necessary part of our daily lives. It's found in fossil fuels - like coal, natural gas, or oil - as well as from more innovative sources, like the oceans, the sun, or wind. It's also found in plant- &amp; other solid-waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It's important to recognize that energy is never created out of thin air, nor can it ever be destroyed; energy is merely converted from one form to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Consider that we have 8+ sources of energy but 86% of them come from "stored solar" energy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 18pt; color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;">How It's Used &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Energy is used by each of us, every day, even when we don't leave our homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We use it to heat and light our homes, we use it for transportation, for entertainment, and to produce and buy the clothes we wear. We also use the energy found in food to sustain our bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As mentioned, energy is neither created nor destroyed. The hiccup is that some <em>useful</em> energy is always lost when we convert it from one form to another! This lost energy is known as "waste energy."</span></p>
