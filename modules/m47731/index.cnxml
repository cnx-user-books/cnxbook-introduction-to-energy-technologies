<newline/><newline/>
Read two case studies about power generation and provide summaries. Both summaries should be included in one document.
<newline/><newline/>
This assignment will be graded per the following rubric:<newline/><newline/>
<media id="rubric" alt="Case Summary Rubric"><download mime-type="application/pdf" src="Rubric.pdf"/></media>
<newline/><newline/>
Please review both of the following case studies from "Crossing the Energy Divide: Moving From Fossil Fuel Dependence to a Clean Energy Future", by Robert and Edward Ayres, Â©2009 Pearson.
<newline/>
<list id="ch"><item>Chapter 2: The Hidden Gold of Energy Recycling</item><item>The CLECO Monopoly, beginning on p. 95</item></list>
For each case study write a brief summary and include the following information:
<newline/>
<list id="cs">
<item>All of the major players.</item>
<item>Their objectives.</item>
<item>Their plans-of-action that achieve said objectives.</item>
<item>Whether their objectives were met.</item>
</list>

If you're unsure of how to proceed, read <link id="how" window="new" url="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_johnson_excorpstrat_7/26/6678/1709611.cw/content/index.html">How to Analyze a Case Study</link> for more information. Don't try to answer every question asked in that guide - those are generic examples. Do expect to give each case study a sufficient amount of thought and analysis. Further, expect to make recommendations based on your reading and analysis. For an example of a case study summary, please see the Project summary report for <link id="nim" window="new" url="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_johnson_excorpstrat_7/26/6678/1709611.cw/content/index.html">Moving Beyond NIMBYism</link>.

One well-written page should be sufficient for this assignment.
